As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time, the British made several attempts on the north ridge route from the Tibetan side. After the first\u00a0reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921\u00a0reached 7,000\u00a0m (22,970\u00a0ft) on the North Col, the\u00a01922 expedition\u00a0pushed the north ridge route up to 8,320\u00a0m (27,300\u00a0ft), marking the first time a human had climbed above 8,000\u00a0m (26,247\u00a0ft). Seven porters were killed in an avalanche on the descent from the North Col. The\u00a01924 expedition\u00a0resulted in one of the greatest mysteries on Everest to this day:\u00a0George Mallory\u00a0and\u00a0Andrew Irvine\u00a0made a final summit attempt on 8 June but never returned, sparking debate as to whether or not they were the first to reach the top. They had been spotted high on the mountain that day but disappeared in the clouds, never to be seen again, until Mallory's body was found in 1999 at 8,155\u00a0m (26,755\u00a0ft) on the north face.\u00a0Tenzing Norgay\u00a0and\u00a0Edmund Hillary\u00a0made the\u00a0first official ascent of Everest in 1953, using the southeast ridge route. Norgay had reached 8,595\u00a0m (28,199\u00a0ft) the previous year as a member of the\u00a01952 Swiss expedition. The Chinese mountaineering team of\u00a0Wang Fuzhou,\u00a0Gonpo, and Qu Yinhua made the first reported\u00a0ascent of the peak from the north ridge\u00a0on 25 May 1960.","count_mem_try":17703.0,"death":279.0,"count_mem_try_female":1373.0,"mean_mem_try_age":35.0769926001,"country_mem_try":["USA","USA\/Switzerland","UK","India","Nepal","Japan","W
